### FMCG PROJECT REPORT

In this project, I delved into the realm of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), which encompasses everyday products and groceries, analyzing a dataset comprising approximately 50,000 records. With a primary objective of creating a user-friendly dashboard using Excel, I embarked on a journey to extract actionable insights from the data, ultimately aiming to enhance decision-making processes within the FMCG industry.

### Approach:

* Industry Research: As FMCG was a relatively new domain for me, I initiated the project by conducting thorough research to gain a comprehensive understanding of the FMCG industry landscape, its key players, market trends, and challenges.

* Data Preparation: Before diving into analysis, it was imperative to ensure the accuracy and readiness of the data. I meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset, addressing any inconsistencies or missing values to facilitate meaningful analysis.

* Data Enrichment: To augment the dataset and enable deeper analysis, I incorporated additional details by creating new columns such as 'margin' and 'category' using Excel's functions. These new attributes provided valuable insights into profitability and product categorization, laying the foundation for more insightful analysis.

* Dashboard Creation: Leveraging Excel's powerful features, I designed a user-friendly dashboard with interactive elements such as slicers for selecting years and regions. This dynamic approach enhanced usability and flexibility, enabling stakeholders to tailor their analysis according to specific criteria.

* Dashboard Components: I developed two distinct dashboards focusing on sales performance and profit analysis. Within these dashboards, I explored various aspects including:
  * Sales and profit trends across different stores and product categories.
  * Monthly fluctuations in sales and profit, identifying key patterns and trends.
  * Identification of top-performing products based on sales volume and profitability.
  * Navigation System: To facilitate seamless navigation between different charts and insights, I implemented an intuitive navigation system within the dashboard, ensuring ease of 
    exploration for users.

### Insights:

* Sales Performance: Analysis revealed insights into the performance of each store, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Understanding regional variations in sales enabled targeted strategies for maximizing revenue.

* Profit Analysis: By dissecting profit margins across product categories, I identified areas of high profitability and areas requiring optimization. This insight guided strategic decisions regarding product assortment and pricing strategies.

* Top Performing Products: Identification of top-selling products and their profitability provided valuable insights into consumer preferences and market demand, informing inventory management and marketing strategies.

#### Conclusion:

This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the FMCG industry, leveraging analytics to drive operational efficiency and strategic growth. By harnessing the power of Excel's analytical capabilities, I demonstrated the potential to unlock actionable insights from vast datasets, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and capitalize on market opportunities effectively.
